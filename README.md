# Manas Shukla - Leadership Style and Principles

## Leadership Style
### Mix of Nurturer and Servant Leadership
I ask what can I do for the team. I am here to serve the team instead of thinking of the team reporting to me.

## Leadership Principles
### 1. Trust and Transparency
Implicit trust and transparency in communication are key. Consistent behavior leads to the development of more trust. 
I believe in being open and honest with my team, fostering an environment where everyone feels comfortable sharing their thoughts and ideas.

### 2. Respect and Humility
Respect and humility are fundamental. Disagreements are natural and healthy, but getting personal is not. We must agree to disagree.
This leads to a lot of psychological safety in the team, and team members do not shy away from asking questions for fear of being ridiculed.

### 3. Always Seek Clarity
Always ask the why. Why are we doing this change? Why is this feature important? Why are the timelines so strict? Seeking more clarity gives more context, leading to a better understanding of the business, feature, and problem statement. 
This helps in coming up with the right solutions instead of just the most optimal ones.

### 4. Fail Fast
Failures are okay. Own them and don't make excuses. 
Failures are just opportunities hiding in disguise. 
Folks are encouraged to try and succeed. If they fail, no harm, no foul. 
This leads to an increased risk appetite in the team, where people are not afraid of trying out new ideas or technology.

### 5. Have a Lot of Fun at Work
Work should be enjoyable! I believe in creating a fun and engaging work environment where team members look forward to coming to work every day. 
Whether it's through team-building activities, casual conversations, or celebrating successes, having fun at work is essential for maintaining high morale and productivity.

## Trust Model
I operate on a foundation of **implicit trust**. From Day 1, I extend full trust to every team member, believing that trust empowers ownership and accountability. This trust remains intact unless there is a clear reason to reassess it. In such cases, I revoke trust completely, granting it incrementally based on actions and alignment.
